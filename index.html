            <h3><span class="text-primary">About</span> Me</h3>
            <p>My name is Oscar Andersson and I'm a positive, ambitious and loyal person with an interest for development, both personal and on the web. A true team-player with several seasons as team-captain in the local football where I gained experience in both leadership and organisation. Professionally experienced as my former role as a Sports Betting Consultant gave me a lot of responsibility, both working individually and collaboration with business partners and colleagues.</p>

            <h3>Where I <span class="text-primary">Come From</span></h3>
            <p>I've spent the substantial part of my professional career in the Sports Betting business working for a company that consults its costumers to pick the right bet of the day. My role at the company regularly increased with more and more responsibility for editing the daily picks, keep other journalists to their deadline and for the last two and a half years I've also written my picks. This job gave me a lot of experience working with the statistic, research, marketing and writing.</p>

            <h3><span class="text-primary">What</span> I Like Doing</h3>
            <p>Brought up by a family that consumed and practised all kinds of sports it came as no shock that I too have a love for sports in general. Football was the one that stood out over the rest among tennis, ice hockey, floorball, golf among others. From the youth team, I've been my local club faithful for nine seasons. Besides active sports and training, I love travelling. South-East Asia has a special place in my heart, so do Australia and New Zeeland. When kicking it back home, I like spending time with my partner playing chess, poker or binge a Netflix series.</p>
