# My Portfolio

In this project I've created a portfolio for my next employer to get to know me a little. I've also linked some of my projects and phone number, email and GitHub account.

The working progress is documented with git and pushed to GitHub along the way. The website is fully responsive for all types of devices and JavaScript is injected to create movement and interaction. The js code is commented with JS Docs.
