# My Portfolio

In this project I've created a portfolio for a school assignment aswell as for future employes. I've linked some of my projects, phone number, email address and GitHub account on the website.

The working progress is documented with git and pushed to GitHub along the way. The website is fully responsive for all types of devices and JavaScript is injected to create movement and interaction. The js code is commented with JS Docs.
